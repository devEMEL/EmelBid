# VeilBook

**Confidential Limit Order Book on Uniswap V4**  
Powered by Zama fhEVM · Deployed on Sepolia

---

## Overview

VeilBook is a confidential limit order book hook built on Uniswap V4. Orders are encrypted using Zama's fhEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) — amounts remain private onchain at all times. Matching happens directly inside the hook's **afterSwap** callback, enabling trustless, MEV-resistant, confidential trading.

Key properties:
- Order amounts are encrypted as `euint64` — never exposed onchain
- Matching occurs inside `afterSwap` — no external keeper required
- Users decrypt their own filled amounts client-side via Zama Relayer
- All pools share a single VeilBook hook via Uniswap V4's hook architecture

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

VeilBook is a Uniswap V4 hook contract. It implements:

- `afterSwap` — matches the completed swap against resting limit orders at the target tick
- `deposit()` — accepts plaintext tokens and mints encrypted ERC20 balance to the user
- `placeOrder()` — creates an encrypted limit order using the user's encrypted token balance
- `cancelOrder()` — cancels an active order and returns unfilled balance
- `claimFill()` — lets users withdraw filled output tokens

### Encrypted Token Flow

Each pool has two EncryptedERC20 contracts (one per currency). When a user deposits:

1. Plaintext tokens transferred into VeilBook
2. Equivalent `euint64` minted to user in the EncryptedERC20 contract
3. User calls `setOperator()` to authorize VeilBook to move their encrypted tokens
4. `placeOrder()` pulls encrypted tokens from user using the operator permission

### Order Matching

When a swap executes through the pool, `afterSwap` loops through resting orders at the current tick. If a matching order exists (opposing direction), amounts are transferred using FHE arithmetic — no plaintext values are revealed during matching.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Hardhat with TypeScript
- `.env` with `MNEMONIC` and `INFURA_API_KEY`

### .env Setup

```
MNEMONIC=your twelve word mnemonic phrase here
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
```

### Deploy Steps

Run each command in order:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --tags MockERC20 --network sepolia
npx hardhat deploy --tags PoolManager --network sepolia
npx hardhat deploy --tags PoolModifyLiquidityTest --network sepolia
npx hardhat deploy --tags PoolSwapTest --network sepolia
npx hardhat deploy --tags StateView --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deployMockUSDC.ts --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deployVeilBookHook.ts --network sepolia
```

## Testing

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### What the Test Covers

The test suite walks through the full lifecycle of a confidential limit order:

1. **Deposit** — User approves and deposits tokens into VeilBook. Plaintext tokens are transferred in and encrypted ERC20 balance is minted to the user
2. **Get encrypted token** — User retrieves the EncryptedERC20 token address for their pool and currency via `getEncryptedToken()`
3. **Set operator** — User calls `setOperator()` on the EncryptedERC20 to authorize VeilBook to spend their encrypted balance
4. **Place order** — User encrypts their order amount client-side using the Zama SDK and calls `placeOrder()`. The encrypted amount is pulled from their balance and stored as an active limit order
5. **Swap & match** — A counterparty swap executes through the pool. `afterSwap` fires and matches the swap against the resting order using FHE arithmetic
6. **Get order** — User calls `getOrder()` and receives `euint64` handles for `filledIn` and `filledOut`
7. **Decrypt** — User decrypts `filledIn` and `filledOut` via the Zama Relayer using an EIP-712 signature. Amounts are revealed only to the user
8. **Claim** — User calls `claimFill()` with the plaintext `filledOut` amount to withdraw their filled output tokens

## FHE / Zama Notes

### Encrypted Handles

`euint64` values returned from `getOrder()` are ciphertext handles (`uint256`). To decrypt client-side:

- Convert handle to hex: `"0x" + handle.toString(16).padStart(64, "0")`
- Call `fhe.userDecrypt()` with the handle and EIP-712 signature
- Result is keyed by hex handle string

### setOperator

Before placing an order, the user must authorize VeilBook as an operator on their EncryptedERC20:

```solidity
encToken.setOperator(VeilBook, uint48(expiryTimestamp))
```

The expiry is `uint48` — pass `BigInt(timestamp)` from the frontend.
